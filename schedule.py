SHIFT SCHEDULING RULES FOR VALIDATION:

RULE 1 - TIERED SHIFT STABILITY (Seniority Privilege):
- Hierarchy Level 1 (most senior): Can stay on same shift for up to 3 consecutive months
- Hierarchy Level 2 (middle): Can stay on same shift for up to 2 consecutive months  
- Hierarchy Level 3+ (junior): Must rotate shifts every month (no stability)
- Example: If a Level 1 employee is on Morning shift in Month 1, they can stay on Morning for Months 2 and 3, but must move to a different shift in Month 4

RULE 2 - FLOATER EXEMPTION:
- Hierarchy Level 1 employees (highest seniority) CANNOT be assigned as floaters
- Only Level 2 and below employees can be floaters
- Floaters are backup staff who cover for absent team members

RULE 3 - FAIR FLOATER ROTATION:
- No employee can be a floater in consecutive months
- If Employee X is a floater in Month 1, they must be assigned to fixed staff in Month 2
- Floater duty should rotate among eligible employees (Level 2+)

RULE 4 - MANDATORY SHIFT ROTATION FOR JUNIORS:
- Level 3+ employees must work a different shift each month
- Example: If a Level 3 employee works Morning in Month 1, they cannot work Morning in Month 2

RULE 5 - MIXED-HIERARCHY COMPOSITION:
- Each shift team should contain employees from different hierarchy levels when possible
- Avoid concentrating all senior or all junior employees on one shift
- Promotes knowledge transfer and balanced teams

RULE 6 - DYNAMIC TEAM COMPOSITION:
- The exact combination of people working together should vary monthly
- Prevents formation of static groups and encourages cross-training

RULE 7 - FLOATER CALCULATION:
- Total floaters = Total team members - (Number of shifts Ã— People per shift)
- If result is 0 or negative, no floaters are assigned
- Each floater is designated to back up a specific shift

VALIDATION CHECKS:
1. Verify Level 1 employees are never in floater positions
2. Check that no employee is floater in consecutive months  
3. Confirm Level 3+ employees have different shifts in consecutive months
4. Ensure each shift has mixed hierarchy levels when team size permits
5. Validate floater count calculation and assignment logic
